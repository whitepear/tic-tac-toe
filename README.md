This application is live at: https://whitepear.github.io/projects/frontend/tictactoe/app/index.html

Users can play a game of tic-tac-toe against an unbeatable opponent. The program can never lose - the best outcome a player can achieve is a draw.

Players can select both the side they'd like to play as, and whether or not they will make the first move. If the player decides to allow the program to go first, it will start in one of two potential positions. This application is responsively-designed.
